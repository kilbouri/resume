# Svelte-Resume

Resume for Jeremie Bornais, created in Svelte.

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd resume
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## This is a Website, not a Resume

Yes, this is a website. BUT, it is also a resume. To turn this into an actual file, simply 'print' the webpage, and save to PDF!

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv).
