Resume for Isaac Kilbourne, created in Svelte.

Based on the foundations written by [Jeremie Bornais](https://github.com/jere-mie/resume). Thanks Jeremie :heart:

## Get started

This project uses [Bun](bun.sh), so you will need to [install Bun](https://bun.sh/) if you have not already.

Then just two commands:

1. `bun install` to install dependencies
2. `bun run dev` to run a development server

## This is a Website, not a Resume

Yes, this is a website. BUT, it is also a resume. To turn this into an actual file, simply 'print' the webpage, and save to PDF!

### Recommended Settings

1. Use `Microsoft Print to PDF` if on Windows. Otherwise, the result will simply be a PDF containing an image, no text.
2. `Margins: none`. The generated resume content contains its own margins.
3. `Scale: Page Width` or `Scale: 100%`.
